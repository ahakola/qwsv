===== Grenades

Some kind of alias for throwing grenades:
All of these assume you have a grenade timer called gren.wav in your fortress\sound -folder. Grap it from the downloads.

=== Simple "first press primes, second press throws" aliases

    alias gren1prime "primeone; play gren; bind [gren1button] gren1throw"
    alias gren1throw "throwgren; bind [gren1button] gren1prime"

    alias gren2prime "primetwo; play gren; bind [gren2button] gren2throw"
    alias gren2throw "throwgren; bind [gren2button] gren2prime"

    bind [gren1button] gren1prime
    bind [gren2button] gren2prime

=== Simple "pressing primes, releasing throws" aliases

    alias +grenone "primeone; play gren"
    alias -grenone  "throwgren"

    alias +grentwo "primetwo; play gren"
    alias -grentwo  "throwgren"
    bind [gren1button] +grenone
    bind [gren2button] +grentwo

=== [Recommended] Grentimer with msg_triggers

Either of 1) or 2) with "play gren" removed.

    alias grentime "play gren"
    msg_trigger grentime "renade primed"

This will make the timing more accurate and will not play the .wav unless the grenade actually was primed (can happen occasionally with 1) or 2) due to lag)
The following commands make grens a little bit more pleasant to use as well:

    alias cleargrens "bind [gren1button] gren1prime; bind [gren2button] gren2prime"
    alias f_death cleargrens

With the typical "press once to prime, another time to throw" -aliases you often have to press twice to prime after dying, these two aliases get rid of the problem.

* Not that msg_triggers do not work with the smackdown -ruleset. Make sure to use ruleset default in your TF -config. *
